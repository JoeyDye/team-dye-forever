After finding out the gender of our baby (a girl!) we decided to hit the ground running decorating the nursery. We started researching cribs, gliders, dressers, changing tables, the whole nine yards. We decided the theme was going to be blush pink, gold, white and possible navy blue with some aqua accents here and there.

We first started with the crib. We found a beautiful crib that was white with natural white-washed wood accents and decided this would be a great match for the delicate look we were going for. After the crib, we needed to find the bedding for it. In conjunction with the soft look of the crib, we found a watercolor, floral bedding with a swan and decided it was the perfect addition to the sleeping area.

Once we had the crib details nailed down, we tackled finding the perfect chair/glider for rocking the baby to sleep. At this point we were still unsure if we wanted to add aqua to the room or not, but ended up going with a soft pink glider, made from the same manufacturer as the crib. The two matched perfectly!

The next step was adding some soft accents, such as a side table that would house a few accessories, floating shelves to act as wall bookshelves and some additional lighting. The whole room started coming together, and Joey was doing a fantastic job assembling all the pieces of each item (endless kudos to him).

As the whole room was starting together, we noticed it needed more touches of kiddieness, a play area of some sort. So we decided to look into getting our baby girl a teepee. We found one one Amazon that fit the bill! It was the perfect combination of soft and subtle, yet it would allow a great place to house baby girlâ€™s imagination! We filled it with pillows, stuffed animals, as well as some baskets to hold toys.
