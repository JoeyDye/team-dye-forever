After devoting time for traveling, focusing on our careers and purchasing our first home, we decided we were ready to take the leap on our next adventure to become parents. It all started on a trip to San Francisco over New Year’s 2018. While we were having a lot of fun in the Bay Area, one of the things on our to-do list was go to a fortune cookie store where you could write your own message inside of a fortune cookie. We each wrote one fortune cookie for each other. As we had already talked about becoming parents the next year, Nicole had the idea that she could use this fortune cookie as the baby reveal for Joey. So she scribbled “You’re going to be a father” on her fortune cookie for Joey.

When they got home from San Francisco, she also went ahead and purchased a onesie from Etsy that said “Hola Papi” so she could also give Joey this when it was time.

Halfway into 2019, the process of trying to get pregnant had begun! After a few months of trying, Nicole had the inkling that this could be the month where they would see that positive test result they had been looking for the past few months. So one day after work, Nicole stopped by Walgreens and purchased a pregnancy test. She got home, and sure enough, it was positive! So now it was time to tell Joey.

At dinner (it was Nacho night - and they were delicious as usual), Nicole suggested that they should open the fortune cookies they had gotten in San Francisco. Joey said that he’d rather wait until a special occasion to open them. Nicole reeeeeally emphasized it’d be a good idea to open it that day, so Joey said “Sure, we’ll do one of the two today”. Nicole opened hers first and in classic Joey wisdom, hers read “To your success!”. After a chuckle, it was Joey’s turn to read his. When he opened it, it read “You’re going to be a father”. To which Joey replied “Oh snap, is this premonition?”. Nicole didn’t know how to respond, so she just said “Hm… what?”, to which Joey cheerfully responded “I think you were supposed to give this to me when you are pregnant”. Nicole handed him a gift bag with the onesie that said “Hola Papi” and the positive pregnancy tests, which allowed Joey to piece the puzzle together. We were overjoyed and even took another trip to Walgreens to buy more to confirm, and all the following were subsequently positive and life as a pair will soon turn into a trio, how exciting!
