After dedicating time for travel, focusing on our careers and purchasing our first home, we decided we were ready to take the leap on our next adventure of becoming parents. It all started on a trip to San Francisco over New Year’s 2018. While we were having a lot of fun in the Bay Area, one of the things on our to-do list was to go to a fortune cookie shop where you could write your own fortune. We each wrote one fortune for each other. As we had already talked about becoming parents the next year, Nicole had the idea that she could use this fortune cookie as the baby reveal for Joey. So, she scribbled “You’re going to be a father” on her fortune for Joey.

When they got home from San Francisco, she also went ahead and purchased a onesie from Etsy that said “Hola Papi” so she could also give Joey this when it was time.

Halfway into 2019, the process of trying to get pregnant had begun! After a few months of trying, Nicole had an inkling that this could be the month where they would see that positive test result they had been waiting for. So one day after work, Nicole stopped by Walgreens and purchased a pregnancy test. She got home, and sure enough, it was positive! Now it was time to tell Joey...

At dinner (it was Nacho night—and they were delicious as usual), Nicole suggested that they should open the fortune cookies they had gotten in San Francisco. Joey said that he’d rather wait until a special occasion to open them. Nicole reeeeeally emphasized it’d be a good idea to open it that day, so Joey said “Sure, we’ll do one of the two today”. Nicole opened hers first and in classic Joey wisdom, hers read “To your success!”. After a chuckle, it was Joey’s turn to read his. He opened the cookie, pulled out the message, and read “You’re going to be a father”. To which Joey replied “Oh snap, is this premonition?”. Nicole didn’t know how to respond, so she just said “Hm… what?”, to which Joey cheerfully responded “I think you were supposed to give this to me when you are pregnant”. Nicole handed him a gift bag with the onesie that said “Hola Papi” and the positive pregnancy tests, which allowed Joey to piece the puzzle together. We were overjoyed and even took another trip to Walgreens, so we could buy more to confirm. All of the following were subsequently positive and life as a pair will soon turn into a trio. How exciting!
