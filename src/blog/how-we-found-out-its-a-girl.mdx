On March 9th we had our first ultrasound appointment! We were very excited and had no idea what to expect. Joey was able to come to the appointment to see our little baby firsthand. It was amazing to see what we had first seen as a little tiny bean grow into a real-life baby. Seeing her arms, spine and even her little toes was absolutely amazing. Going into it, Nicole knew she wanted to wait to find out the gender with both of our families together…. Joey, on the other hand, was not so sure. So we compromised and decided Joey would get to find out 24 hours before the Gender Reveal party. After the appointment, we were handed an envelope that held the gender of our future baby! Nicole was placed in charge of safekeeping the envelope and handing it to Joey 24 hours prior to the party.

Fast forward 5 days (which felt like an eternity) to the day before the gender reveal party, and Joey was handed the envelope. He then went into the nursery, played some music, and opened the envelope. As he read the gender, he envisioned what it would be like to raise this little baby, and what life would be like with the third member of our crew. He was delighted and now the poker face had to be on. When he came down the stairs, Nicole looked at him, but he could not make any eye contact, as to not give away any clues.

The next morning, with Joey knowing the gender, we drove to Party City to purchase the either blue or pink filling for the piñata we had purchased a few weeks back. Joey went in, while Nicole went to a store nearby, so Joey could purchase the corresponding color. We got back home and Joey filled the piñata. We were set now to head down to Tim and Dani’s house for the gender reveal.

Once we arrived, we were greeted with beautiful decorations—some with “He or She, what will it be?” or a fun old wives tales game we could all play together. There was also a taco bar (which if you know Nicole, she loves a good taco) with decorations that said “Let’s taco about a baby” and a beautifully-made Dr. Seuss Horton Hears A Who cake made by Nicole's sister Jo!

After everyone ate, we got down to business, played some games, and finally the moment came. Ben insisted that it was the ultimate “Tio” (uncle) duty to hold the piñata as we pulled the string to reveal the gender, so he held a stick with the piñata as Joey and Nicole pulled the strings with all their might.

What came next was an explosion of pink and gold! It’s a girl! The whole room cheered and it was amazing to find out we were going to have a beautiful baby girl.
